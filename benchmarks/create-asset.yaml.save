  description: >-
    This is a duration based benchmark targeting a Hyperledger Fabric network
    using the `fixed-asset` NodeJS chaincode
    contract that is interacted with via a Fabric-SDK-Node Gateway. Each test
    round invokes the `createAsset` method, with successive rounds increasing
    the byteSize of the asset added into the world state database.

        Test a submitTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS
        `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `createAsset`, which inserts
        an asset of size 32000 bytes into the World State database.
